<h1>Towers of Hanoi</h1>

<h4>Puzzle Origin</h4>

<p>
    The puzzle was introduced to the West by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas in 1883. Numerous myths regarding the ancient and mystical nature of the puzzle popped up almost immediately,[4] including one about an Indian temple in Kashi Vishwanath containing a large room with three time-worn posts in it, surrounded by 64 golden disks. Acting out the command of an ancient prophecy, Brahmin priests have been moving these disks in accordance with the immutable rules of Brahma since that time. The puzzle is therefore also known as the Tower of Brahma. According to the legend, when the last move of the puzzle is completed, the world will end.
</p>
<p>
    If the legend were true, and if the priests were able to move disks at a rate of one per second, using the smallest number of moves, it would take them 264 − 1 seconds or roughly 585 billion years to finish,[6] which is about 42 times the current age of the universe[5].
